## Installation instructions

```bash
python3 -m pip install cultivate.tar.gz
cultivate
```

Note to OSX Mojave users: The `pip install`ed version of PyGame is basically broken on OSX.
It is suggested to install PyGame from source (and against SDL 2).
This can be done by running the following commands:
```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_gfx sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_net sdl2_ttf
git clone https://github.com/pygame/pygame.git
cd pygame
python setup.py -config -auto -sdl2
python setup.py install
```
